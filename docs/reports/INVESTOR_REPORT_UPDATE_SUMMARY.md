## 📞 INVESTOR COMMUNICATION

### Key Messages:

**For Conservative Investors:**
> "We're taking a measured, quality-focused approach. Starting with 30 drivers lets us perfect operations before scaling. Year 1 invests in foundation, Year 2 delivers strong returns."

**For Growth Investors:**
> "Our conservative Year 1 ($261K revenue) sets up explosive Year 2 growth ($1.9M revenue, $560K profit). We're building for sustainable long-term dominance, not quick unsustainable growth."

**For Risk-Averse Investors:**
> "We're managing risk by starting small (30 drivers), validating the model, then scaling rapidly. Year 1 proves the concept with $98K cash remaining for Year 2 expansion."
