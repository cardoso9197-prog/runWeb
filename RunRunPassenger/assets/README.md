# Run Run Passenger App - Assets Placeholder

To complete the app setup, please copy the Run-Run logo.png to this assets folder:

1. Copy: `../Run-Run logo.png`
2. Paste as: `assets/icon.png` (1024x1024 recommended)
3. Paste as: `assets/splash.png` (2048x2048 recommended)
4. Paste as: `assets/adaptive-icon.png` (1024x1024 recommended)
5. Paste as: `assets/favicon.png` (48x48 recommended)

You can use the same logo image for all placeholders initially.

The logo should be:
- PNG format
- Transparent background (if possible)
- Minimum 512x512 pixels
- Square aspect ratio

For now, placeholder icon files are expected by Expo.
